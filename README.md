# Ruby Hashes

A Hash is a Ruby data type that can contain other
data values. Unlike an Array, where values are kept in
order, values in a Hash are stored by unique _keys_.
This results in hashes behaving more like
_dictionaries_ - in a dictionary, if you know the word,
you can look up its definition. In a hash, if you know
the key, you can access the associated value.

This section contains additional lessons and labs on hashes
in Ruby. Topics in this section include:

* Creating hashes
* Reading and updating hashes
* Creating nested hashes
* Reading and updating nested hashes

It is recommended that you complete all the lessons in the Prework 
section **Programming as Conversation Part 4: Collection Data Types: 
Array and Hash** before working on these lessons.
